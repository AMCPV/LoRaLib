This library enables easy long range communaction with SX1278-based LoRa modules. It was designed to be used with LoRenz Rev.B shields. However, they are not required and this library can be used with any LoRa module, as long as it is based on the SX1278 chip.

## As a part of the API changes, all documentation has been moved to the [Wiki](https://github.com/jgromes/LoRaLib/wiki)! ##
